1. I would fit the automated tests in my Recipe project development pipeline within a GitHub action that runs whenever code is pushed. Running tests only locally or after all development is completed could lead to integration issues, delayed detection of bugs, and inconsistencies between different developers' environments. Therefore, integrating automated tests within GitHub actions provides a more robust and efficient workflow.
